## Body Pose Detection

# Intro:
This project is a human body pose detection and extraction tool. I chose a short video showing a person playing basketball.
With this project, I can visualize the player's poses in the video and extract these poses for further analysis.

# Tech Stack:

Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Patience ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

# Features:
Track different parts of the body;
Identify different reference points in these parts of the body;
Use landmarks to create the complete body posture.


# Process:
I started this project using the MediaPipe library for pose detection in a basketball video.
Initially, I set up video capture using OpenCV and then used MediaPipe's pose detection functionality to obtain the positions of the landmarks.
The poses were visualized both in the original video and in a separate image, highlighting the extracted pose.

# Difficulties:

Manipulation of landmark coordinates to highlight the pose;
Handle different video resolutions;
Stylization of landmarks and connection lines to improve visualization - I experimented with different styles and techniques to highlight these elements in a clear and informative way.

# Learnings:
I learned how to use the MediaPipe library for pose detection;
I learned how to manipulate video frames and extract poses;
I developed skills in stylizing landmarks and connection lines for a more informative visualization.
I learned how to integrate MediaPipe's functionalities into computer vision projects.

# âœ¨Improvements:

Style: Improve the stylization of landmarks for a more aesthetic visualization + Explore advanced visual highlighting techniques in connection lines;
Improve code efficiency to handle different video resolutions;

Add specific analysis features to the extracted poses;

Test whether the algorithm I used is capable of detecting the pose of more than one person in the video;

Try another algorithm that can capture body segments with fast movements.

I've included a visual example of the detected and extracted poses:
